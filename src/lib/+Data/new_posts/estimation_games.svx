# Easy Estimation Warm Ups

Asking students to predict a math answer and explain how they got there is a great for focusing attention on skills in a relaxed way.
- following social constructivist principles, using vocabulary to articulate thinking enhances learning

- estimation is a low barrier to entry that can get even the most nervous math students to have a try
	example activity: draw a line on the board to estimate how long 60cm is when learning about formal measurements.
	example activity: build a numberline together of estimated measurements of items of a similar length
	
	
	
In my experience, one of the most effective ways to refocus students' attention on mathematical concepts is by incorporating low-stakes, engaging warm-ups into our lessons. For me, "Easy Estimation Warm Ups" has proven to be a game-changer in creating a supportive learning environment.

By leveraging social constructivist principles and encouraging vocabulary development, these warm-ups not only help build students' confidence but also lay the groundwork for more in-depth mathematical explorations. The beauty of estimation lies in its accessibility – it's an approach that can even the most apprehensive math students into participating.

One of my favorite examples of this is using a simple drawing activity on the board. For instance, when we're learning about formal measurements, I'll draw a line to estimate how long 60cm is. This exercise not only gets students thinking creatively but also helps them develop their ability to articulate their thought process – a crucial aspect of mathematical problem-solving.

Another strategy that's been successful for me is building a number line together with students. We take turns estimating the length of various items, and as we build our collective understanding, we refine our estimates until we reach a more precise answer. This collaborative approach not only fosters a sense of community but also helps students see the value in working together to achieve a common goal.

One area for improvement I've noticed is that sometimes these warm-ups can feel too simplistic. To address this, I'd like to explore ways to make them even more engaging and challenging, while still maintaining their accessibility. Perhaps we could incorporate real-world applications or have students create visual aids to present their estimates – these small tweaks could significantly enhance the impact of our lessons.

Overall, incorporating "Easy Estimation Warm Ups" into my teaching practice has been a valuable investment in my students' mathematical confidence and skills. By keeping things simple yet engaging, I've found that we can build a strong foundation for more complex concepts and create a supportive learning environment that encourages students to take risks and explore their creativity.
