## Example of starting with bigger questions like will the answer be less than/more than, why?
I've found that many students who struggle with math haven't built up the low resolution math skills to quickly assess the kind of answer to expect. Will the answer be bigger or smaller? What makes sense?
Low resolution math activities that build intuition can be a quick way to review concepts, and let the student know they're on the right track, even when the specifics of a mathematical operation are tricky for them.
Shifting emphasis to understanding an estimation, even when the mathematics is still developing, can ease the dreaded math anxiety, which can interrupt learning and disengage students entirely. 
Work towards specificity, but focus on intuition. 

In my journey as a teacher, I've often observed that many of my students who struggle with math face challenges not necessarily due to a lack of ability but because they haven't yet developed the foundational skills needed for quick and confident mathematical reasoning. This includes intuitively knowing whether an answer should be larger or smaller than another.

Through this experience, I realized the importance of incorporating low-resolution math activities into my teaching approach. These exercises are designed to build students' intuition by encouraging them to think about numbers in a broader sense, allowing them to grasp the "bigger picture" before diving into complex calculations. For instance, asking students whether multiplying two numbers will result in a larger or smaller number than one of those factors is a simple yet powerful way to cultivate this kind of thinking.

This shift towards emphasizing estimation and intuitive understanding helps mitigate math anxietyâ€”a common barrier that can significantly disrupt learning. By focusing on intuition before precision, I've seen students become more confident and engaged, as they start recognizing their ability to make sense of mathematical problems even when the specifics seem daunting.

Moving forward, I aim to continue refining this method, perhaps by incorporating more collaborative activities that allow students to share their thought processes with peers. Such exchanges can provide additional insights into different ways of thinking and further alleviate the pressure that precise calculations often impose on learners still building their mathematical confidence.

In essence, nurturing intuition in mathematics is not just about simplifying numbers; it's about empowering students to trust their reasoning skills and fostering a love for learning that transcends equations.
