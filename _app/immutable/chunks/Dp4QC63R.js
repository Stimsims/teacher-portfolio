This was the case in a very social classroom where independent writing tasks often led to distraction or disengagement. Instead of pushing back against that energy, I redesigned some writing activities to work in pairs, using open-ended sentence starters like:</p> <h4>“We didn’t get along at first, but…”</h4> <!> <p>The structure gave students a social entry point into creative writing, and opened space for imaginative collaboration — including a story about a narwhal named Rosurey that still makes me smile.</p> <!> <p>At the same time, I wanted to ensure students were getting meaningful, individualised feedback on their writing. Referencing Hattie’s (2009) findings about the impact of quality assessment, I experimented with a low-tech solution to a high-pressure reality: time. I photographed anonymised student work and used AI tools to generate feedback tailored to each piece. This allowed me to offer more specific guidance than would otherwise be possible during a busy week.</p> <!> <p>What stood out most was how students who previously struggled with writing — including those still working on basic phonemes — became more willing to take risks. The combination of a socially responsive structure and timely feedback helped them see writing as something within reach. These small shifts, while modest, felt deeply meaningful — and reminded me that sometimes the best way to support students is to meet them where they are, then gently open the door.</p>",1);function x(w){var s=U(),a=e(u(s),6);const o=r(()=>[L]);i(a,{get images(){return t(o)}});var n=e(a,4);const p=r(()=>[c,f,b]);i(n,{get images(){return t(p)}});var m=e(n,4);const l=r(()=>[R]);i(m,{get images(){return t(l)}}),d(2),h(w,s)}export{x as default};
