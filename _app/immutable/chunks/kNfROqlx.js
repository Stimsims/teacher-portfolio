I think math shines brightest when it’s used as a language to explore other topics.
In this lesson, I got kids up and active, recording data about migratory birds. Students took turns playing as birds (prey), cats (predators) and scientists who recorded how many birds successfully migrated across the court. The lesson was so successful kids were able to explain how more predators or less food in winter made survival less likely for birds. This was excellent mathematical language for a year two class. Best of all, the kids asked to try the lesson again days later, indicating they remembered the game and the data it generated.</p> <h2>Lesson Plan</h2> <h2>Animal Needs: Migratory Animals – The Rainbow Bee-eater</h2> <p><strong>Year Level</strong> Grade 2</p> <p><strong>Subject</strong> Science</p> <p><strong>Resources:</strong> BBC Bitesize Food Chain Video, eBird Migration Map, space to play a game of tag, science journals</p> <p><strong>Presumed knowledge:</strong> Bar charts</p> <p><strong>Pedagogy:</strong> 4E’s: engage, explore, explain, evaluate</p> <p><strong>Learning intention:</strong> To gather data on winter food availability and migratory animal survival rates</p> <p><strong>Success Criteria:</strong></p> <ul><li>I can describe how an animals body parts help them to survive the winter</li> <li>I can describe how seasons effect animal survival</li> <li>I can make a chart of the data gathered about bird survival and food availability, understand how bodily features help them survive the winter</li></ul> <h4>Lesson Summary</h4> <p>Resources: sacks/cones to represent food
Engage:</p> <ul><li>Watch the <strong><a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/teach/class-clips-video/articles/zbr8d6f" rel="nofollow">BBC Bitesize Food Chain video</a></strong>. ask “What happens if one part of the chain disappears?” Connect with winter and survival rates.</li> <li>Ask non-volunteer students with EDI sticks to organise a food chain on whiteboard, using printed food and animal cards</li> <li>Watch the migration video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TmFJCOwYlI" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TmFJCOwYlI</a> Explore:</li> <li>play three rounds of migration tag. Students are predators or prey. Prey have to pick up a piece of food and avoid predators to survive. Each round has less food (12, 8, 4). Ask two students to record how many ‘birds’ survive in each round.</li> <li>teacher models drawing bar chart of prey survival rates on the board. Students copy into their inquiry books.
Explain:</li> <li>introduce the Australian rainbow honey eater: <strong>Rainbow Bee-eater Introduction</strong> <a href="https://birdlife.org.au/bird-profiles/rainbow-bee-eater/" rel="nofollow">https://birdlife.org.au/bird-profiles/rainbow-bee-eater/</a> and their migration patterns with the <strong><a href="https://science.ebird.org/status-and-trends/species/rabeat1/range-map" rel="nofollow">eBird migration map</a></strong></li> <li>Explain the body parts God gave the honey eater to help it survive.

Discuss:</p> <ul><li>“What happens when food disappears?”</li> <li>“When do we have less food outside?” (Guide them to <strong>winter</strong>.)</li></ul> <p>Watch the migration video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TmFJCOwYlI" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TmFJCOwYlI</a></p> <hr/> <h3>Explore (20 minutes)</h3> <p>Investigate <strong>why and how</strong> animals migrate, focusing on the Rainbow Bee-eater:</p> <ol><li>Play <strong>Migration Tag Game</strong><br/> Simulate real-world survival: <ul><li>Roll dice to determine: <ul><li>Number of <strong>birds</strong> (students running)</li> <li>Number of <strong>predators</strong> (students tagging)</li> <li>Number of <strong>food pieces</strong> (cones or beanbags)</li></ul></li> <li>Birds run from one “habitat” to another, picking up food while avoiding predators.
